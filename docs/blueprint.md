- Background color: Light blue (#E5EAF7), a soft, desaturated variant of the primary, for a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Purple (#9D4EDD), to add a touch of modernity and differentiation, while still remaining harmonious with the primary.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and short amounts of text, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Simple, geometric icons to match the modern sans-serif fonts; icons for various data points (customer status, employee performance, etc.) should be easily recognizable.
- Clean and structured layout; use of cards to display data in a segmented manner for better readability, and intuitive navigation with clear labels.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to improve user experience, like a smooth fade-in for newly loaded data or a progress bar during Excel import.
